 Hi, I’m @Anushkarshetty45
I’m interested in GitHub because it helps with version control and makes it easier to work on coding projects with others. It's a great tool for keeping track of code changes and contributing to open-source projects.
 I’m currently learning Engineering CSE ,1st year
 I’m looking to collaborate on Python coding challenges (LeetCode, etc.),and since i've started with django ,i'd like to do Web development projects using Django
 How to reach me email=anushkarshetty45@gmail.com,instagram=anushkarshetty080
 Pronouns:she/Her
Fun fact:I'm a first-year Computer Science student at MS Ramaiah Institute of Applied Sciences, and I love diving into coding, web development, and space exploration!
